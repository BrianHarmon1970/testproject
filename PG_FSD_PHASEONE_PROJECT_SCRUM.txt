Design driven requirements:
	User interface subsystem
		User input components
			user prompt display 
			user data collection
			
		User Display component
			welcome screen display
			sub screen  display
		input validation and error handling

	File/Directory Subsystem
		directory listing acquisition and sorting
		file selection and validation
		file creation 
		file deletion
		error detection and response
	
	easy and wholly complete items will be prioritized for the first sprint. additional items will 
	be split according to function and scale among the total number of sprints.
	==============================================
	Project Planning
	==============================================
	The project will be implmented in 3 sprints, 5 days each.
	each sprint will be planned independently according 
	to regular SCRUM practices. product will be developed in 
	3 potientially deliverable increments however featues may
	be few in the initial sprints.
